#
## Step 1: Initiate Git in Parent Directory
### Here are the instructions and codes I used to get it right:
### First create a parent directory with a unique name that 
### will serve as your repository name. Then run this command
```
git init
```
_NB:* Ony run this if you have not initiated git in this directory earlier_
**_This parent directory can contain as many sub-directories and files as
your project requires_**
#
## Step 2: Create a url on GitHub
### Next go to GitHub and create an empty repository bearing the same name
### as the parent directory you earlier created in your local computer.
### Remember to add a brief description, then copy the url.

## Step 3: Push New Repository to GitHub
### From your terminal or code editor in your local computer run the following commands:
```
git add .
git commit -m "brief description of the commit or repo"
git remote add <nameofrepo> <repo url>
git push <nameofrepo>
Repo name must be consistent
```
### _NB:* For this to work you must have pushed a repo before that means,
your local computer has been configured for Git. Follow this [Link](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/push-to-github/) to
learn how to configure your local machine and push your first git repository._

Hurray! 🎉🎊you just created a new repo on GitHub from your local computer 👏
