# Vagrante Virtual Box
---
## Why I won't use vegrante now:
```
1. I already have Ubuntu installed on my local machine ontop WSL
2. I am a novince, hence I am not really trying to avert software clashes
3. The extraload is not worth it for me: Vagrante virtual machine allows me to run a virtual sandbox for ubuntu and I don't mind using Ubuntu from my local machine ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

```
